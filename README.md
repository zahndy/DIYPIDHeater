Simple PID based heater where Arduino drives mosfet to control 12V heat load.
Up/Down switches for target temperature control.
flip/rocker switch and relay connected to ATX psu ps-on for toggling 12V power.
2x16 char LCD display.
The setup I build is almost the same as the bottom part of a 3D printer.
3D printer beds and heating elements are easy to obtain.
